# DOCKER

## AGENDA : 

1. Docker Image and Container

2. Some basics commands with Docker

3. Create a Docker image

4. Run it as a container

## Whay is Docker?

- Docker is a platform that allows developers to easily create, deploy, and run applications in containers.

## What are Docker Container?

- Docker Containers are a lightweight form of virtualization that allow an application and its dependencies to run in an isolated environment, without affecting the host system or other containers running on it.

> NOTE : A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. 

## What is Docker Image?

- An image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

- Docker images are built from a series of layers, which are similar to snapshots. Each layer represents a command in the Dockerfile and its associated file system changes. This allows images to be built incrementally and reused, reducing the size of the final image.

### HOUSE REAL LIFE EXAMPLE for better understanding of the Docker, container, and image.<br><br>

<br>

- It is the efficient way to move all items/containers from House-A to House-B, and If we have to move each item/container for eg. TV set one-by-one then it takes huge amount of efforts, time and a lot of travel round or operations if we carry each item and place them one-by-one to house-B.

- In Similar way, we can imagine Docker as "the Movers and Packers team" (who pack your items into containers and put them into truck and move from one environment to another).

- Lets look into example of two developers from development team.
We have Developer-1 and Developer-2

- Developer-1 try to install multiple packages and software applications in his system and all the packages and software installed successfully.

- Developer-2 she also try to install all those packages and softwares which are installed by Developer-1 but one of the software application give error while installation, both are connected to the Dev Server but Application still running on the server but that application stop running in Developer-2 local system because she fails to provide the same/compatible environment for Application. 

- Quality Assurance (QA) team also fails to run the application because of that missed or failed installation. This leads to conflict between Developers and QA Team. For resolving this conflicts Google introduce docker.

## Difference between Docker images and Docker containers :

- A Docker image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files. Docker images are built from a series of layers, which are similar to snapshots. Each layer represents a command in the Dockerfile and its associated file system changes. This allows images to be built incrementally and reused, reducing the size of the final image.

- A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. When you run a command like ```docker run <image>```, Docker creates a new container from the image and starts it. The container runs in an isolated environment, separate from the host system and other containers, but it has access to the host's resources, such as the network and the file system.

- Each container can have different runtime and configuration settings, but they are all based on the same image. You can think of an image as a class and a container as an instance of that class.

- You can also create multiple containers from the same image and run them simultaneously, each with its own isolated environment and resources.

- Docker images are stored in a registry, such as Docker Hub, where they can be shared and reused by other users. You can also create your own images and share them on a registry or within your organization.

**Base image :** The base image / base OS, where entire application can be run.
It can be of Linux, ubuntu, windows according to the requirements.

- In next layer, suppose we have to install python 3.7 -> it is called the sub-layer-image (or) sub-image (or) sub-sub-sub-part.

- Similar, way other dependencies are set layer-by-layer or in sub-sub-sub layer.

All the dependencies, set layer-by-layer and combine-ly called as Docker Image.

- When we pass, this docker image to another developer then developer can run this docker image inside Host machine in the form of container, so, we can say Docker Image is an Artifact.

- This container is running on the developer host machine and docker image run inside container.
